    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nI just bought VR Player for Android, using it on my Galaxy S3, and trying to play 360 video, like the one l found on this page : <a href=\"http://vrplayer.tv/archives/490\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vrplayer.tv/archives/490</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nThe 450Mb mp4 video doesn't play, I get sound but only black screen. I tried reencoding it but can't seem to find a format that will make it play.\r<br />\n<br />\nCould you point me in the right direction here ? Is there a video / audio codec combination that just works every time ? Do I have to be careful about anything else, like pixel aspect, video size, bitrate ?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks a lot\r<br />\n<br />\nPS : as someone else pointed out in another thread, I am also experiencing the weird black artefacts, in Sphere and Dome modes.<br />\n",
