I'm in the same boat as Matt.\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/xfUSI\" rel=\"nofollow\">I also made a gallery which shows how different settings in VR Player look. Also I include a sample image you can download and use for testing purposes.</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nI just want to say; well done. Even with these issues we're seeing, this is still one of the coolest experiences I've had with the Oculus Rift. We already have a huge library of productions that used to be limited to a very small scale environment, that VR Player will be opening up to a larger audience. If the VR Player community keeps growing and generating content; this will be huge! Very cool Stephane.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso I would be happy to throw in some beer money to help this work its way up your TODO list, just send me a message with details.<br />\n",

It will be available in the next release.\r<br />\nIn the meanwhile, you can send me your email in private message for a preview version. Also, if you already have a lot of full dome content, please feel free to share video/samples to <a href=\"http://www.vrplayer.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">vrplayer.tv</a>!\r<br />\n<br />\nBest regards,,\r<br />\n<br />\n-Stephane<br />\n",
