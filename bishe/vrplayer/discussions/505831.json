    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nI am trying to have a stream from my webcam on VR player. But, there is something weird with my webcam. In VLC player, it opens with a very low fps when I try defaults, but when I change video input frame rate from advanced options it looks fine. Maybe it's something related to vlc player, because it looks fine with other players also. I don't know, I am not an advanced vlc user :/\r<br />\n<br />\nSo, I was wondering if there is an option to change default fps for stream in VR player? Or any other possible solution/suggestion (with VLC/webcam) maybe?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
