Can anyone help advising what's the limit so far?\r<br />\n<br />\nMy test was a side by side 3D360 video 5768x1384@48fps (bit rate ~30000kbps), not stitched properly as a workflow exercise. However, it usually mess up in the mid way, (<a href=\"http://ge.tt/4dbaZyP1/v/0\" rel=\"nofollow\">see it here</a>) but 30 fps will be fine. All the video were becoming pixelated &amp; slow in response.\r<br />\nNot sure what had gone wrong, but the VLC player alone can play the spherical video smoothly.(snapshot <a href=\"http://ge.tt/1KyzZyP1/v/0\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>)\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks.<br />\n",
