If you are using the oculus rift, everything should be calibrated by default.\r<br />\nYou can try changing manually the horizontal offset in tools-&gt;settings-&gt;display just in case there is a problem with the shortcuts.\r<br />\nIn the next version I should support presets so it will be easier to manage and reset calibration data.\r<br />\n<br />\n-Stephane<br />\n",
