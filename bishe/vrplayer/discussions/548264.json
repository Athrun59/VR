I compiled my DLLs with SharpDevelop which work on my computers, but everyone I have tried sharing them with has been unable to get their VR Player to recognize them, which can be frustrating. And their setups are usually similar to mine: 64-bit Windows 7/8, VR Player installed as 32-bit. I supply links to ZIP files that contain the folder containing the DLL, and instruct them to place that folder into Plugins in the VR Player installation. <br />\n<a href=\"https://developer.oculusvr.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;t=8998\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.oculusvr.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=8998</a><br />\nYour &quot;Plugins creation&quot; guide is still just a &quot;Todo&quot; page, so I don't know if I'm missing any important plugin creation steps. I could share my project source if that helps. <br />\n",
