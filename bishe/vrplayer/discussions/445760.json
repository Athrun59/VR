    "Html": "Hello Cyclops,\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you very much I appreciate your support.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe Player is still experimental and I did not have the chance to test on a lot of hardware so there is no documentation about good practices yet.\r<br />\n<br />\nSome people have reported to have good results with 4096x2048 for mono spherical movies.\r<br />\nWith a good PC with hardware acceleration, 4096x4096 for stereo movies should work reasonably well but it takes a lot of storage space and compression really affects performances. Resolutions in the range of 4K is probably overkill for the oculus dev kit. You can get away with less but keep in mind that consumer version will have higher resolution.\r<br />\n<br />\nBase on my experience, I would recommend using base 2 values for resolution and a h.264 codecs (.mp4 or .f4v).\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope this is helping.\r<br />\n<br />\n-Stephane<br />\n",
