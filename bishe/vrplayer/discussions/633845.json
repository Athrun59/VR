I'm using VR Player with a cardboard on my Nexus 5 and it works well except that the orientation keeps drifting. What I mean is that the projection sometimes jerk one way or another and some other times it will very slowly drift to one side, resulting in a necessity to recalibrate every 30 seconds or so, pretty annoying.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've tried all the different orientation settings, but the problem appears with all of them. Is there something wrong with my phone perhaps? It wouldn't be too much of a problem if I could use the magnetic trigger to recalibrate, however it doesn't seem to be recognized by the application.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you.<br />\n",
