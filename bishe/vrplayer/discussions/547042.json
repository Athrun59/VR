When I tried to load my video from youtube, the VRPlayer was likely to load the one with lowest quality. There was no option in the setting tab. Can anyone tell if it is possible to load higher quality video by changing some system settings? thanks\r<br />\n<br />\np.s. I was unable to share this video to the vrplayer.tv, as the wordpress kept saying the video was not uploaded, but it is actually there.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers,\r<br />\nKC<br />\n",
