Relaunch VR Player.\r<br />\n<br />\nExample:<br />\n<pre><code> {&quot;Key&quot;:&quot;Options&quot;,&quot;Value&quot;:&quot;-v --file-logging&quot;}</code></pre>\n\nIf this work as expected, a console will popop with vlc debug informations when you will launch a video.\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease let me know if you see an obvious error in the console log.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you,\r<br />\n<br />\n-Stephane<br />\n",
