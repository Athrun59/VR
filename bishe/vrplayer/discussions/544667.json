Is it possible to add a new mode for the dual fisheye? defishing fisheye video is a complicated ffmpeg+imagemagick work, but I believe it can be done on-the-fly quickly within VRPlayer. thanks\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://ge.tt/4YOgqNg1/v/0?c\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> is a defished image for testing.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers,\r<br />\nKC <br />\n",

Currently remapping the circular fisheye to equirectangular is time consuming (not possible to deal with video stitcher, so have to do with ptgui, but ptgui\r\n cannot output jpg without blending, so have to output as psd layers & to be flatten in PS action. Looking forward to your next version. I believe it would be very helpful in promoting the use of vrplayer on desktop & smartphone if you accept such easy-to-make\r\n content.</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>KC</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n",
