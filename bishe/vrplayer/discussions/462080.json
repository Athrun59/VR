But I came up on a few problems.\r<br />\n<br />\nUnder the file menu I notice there was a option to open disk from vlc.  So I try to play a movie from my DVD drive.  The movie loaded up to the main menu just fine.  Well it took a while to load, but that wasnt the problem.  The problem was when it loaded up, it was at the main menu.  And there is no control support to click play to start the movie.  Is there any way maybe you can add control support to play the movie.  With the keyboard or mouse. better yet maybe able to keymap to a xbox controller.  That way I can fast forward and stuff like that also.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks keep up the good work<br />\n",
