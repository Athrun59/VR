    "Html": "Hi maddabbo,\r<br />\n<br />\nCurrently it's not possible because of the DRM.\r<br />\n<br />\nI see 2 possible solutions:\r<br />\n<br />\n-Playing netflix on a second monitor, capture the stream and project the result in VR Player. You can try with File-&gt;Open-&gt;Process but it's very slow. I would have to create a new directX implementation for capturing the screen instead of the process. (This feature is in my backlog)\r<br />\n<br />\n-The second solution would be to integrate a web browser in VR Player. An other feature planned for future versions.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf some one has a better idea, please let me know :)\r<br />\n<br />\n-Stephane<br />\n",
