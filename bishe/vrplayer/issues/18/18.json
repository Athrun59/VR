    "Description": "Hello, \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter freshly installing VR Player on a new machine and all I'm getting is a black screen as seen in the attached screenshot. I couldn't open the samples or anything else at first but upon uninstalling VLC, reinstalling the latest version and then reinstalling VR Player I was then able to open videos.\r\n\r\nFor some reason I still can't open the samples, and have no idea what would cause this. It's not a major issue, as this is on a business machine and not a regular Rift capable machine, but I still wanted to post about it in case anyone has any advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
